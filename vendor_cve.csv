However it is also possible to obtain the keys from a JWK keystore file, by setting the configuration parameter ""rs.security.keystore.type"" to ""jwk"". For this case all keys are returned in this file ""as is"", including all private key and secret key credentials. This is an obvious security risk if the user has configured the signature keystore file with private or secret key credentials.
